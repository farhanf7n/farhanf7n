Hey, I am a Frontend Developer based in Pakistan.
<br>
<br>

A passionate and self-taught Frontend Developer with 4 years of hands-on experience crafting visually stunning and user-centric web experiences. Leveraging expertise in React.js, JavaScript, and modern CSS frameworks (Tailwind, Material, Bootstrap), I bridge the gap between design and development through proficiency in Figma. What sets me apart is my dual proficiency as both a developer and designer â€“ I don't just code solutions, I envision them. When not building for clients, I'm experimenting with emerging technologies and sharing creative UI designs on Dribbble, demonstrating my commitment to continuous growth and innovation.
